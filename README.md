# Coffee-Machine
 Simple program that simulates a Coffee Machine.
 
 Right now it supports the following actions:
  - Checking contents (ingredients, cups, money) of the machine
  - Buying 3 different types of coffee
  - Adding contents (ingredients, cups, money) to the machine
  - Taking the money from the machine
  
Runs on a while loop, and uses switches to create a simple main method that will access specific methods depending on user input.

Can easily be modified due to the organization of the code.

TO DO:
  - Refactor program into Object Oriented Programming, creating a general Coffee Machine class.
  - Adding different coffee types
  - User-created recipes
  - More ingredients
